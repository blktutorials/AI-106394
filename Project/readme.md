# How we achieved each task:
Our group was unable to understand what the errors were but we researched and then were able to work on the project.
We took the code from GCR,the datasets from kaggle and used it to apply the techniques on the three given matrices i.e 5x5 , 7x7 and 9x9 along with two different filters which are same for the other two sizes of matrices.
# Filter #1:
          ([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])

# Filter #2:
          ([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
            [1, 2, 2, 2, 1],
            [1, 2, 3, 2, 1],
            [1, 2, 2, 2, 1],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])

# Contribution of each member:
We had 6 techniques so we divided two each techniques to one member and assigned all three matrices with the two filters aswell.

# 1:Bushra Liaquat Khan :
I've applied **Linear Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbours** on 5x5, 7x7, 9x9 matrices with two filters which are mentioned above.
I have attached all of the outputs of the code in a MS Word document as "screenshot". I asked my group members to search and commit the description of the techniques they applied and what they learned from the techniques I did all of the documentation and tried my best to explain what we all did in our project.
# Description of important parts of .py file:
# Description of techniques:
All of following machine learning algorithms are supervised machine learning algorithm and now you would ask “**what exactly is supervised machine learning**?” and to answer that I will give you a real life example,
Suppose we have child and we are it’s supervisor i.e. parent and we want the child to learn how to identify different animals.We want our child to learn how a cat looks like. What we will do inorder to make the child learn what a cat looks like, we will show the child several pictures of the cat and few others of the different animals so the child can be able to identify the difference between the cat. While showing the child pictures of the cat we will shout “**cat**!” (when actually a picture of a cat appears)and when it’s some another animal we shout “**it’s not a cat!**” so after showing several pictures then we ask the the child  and they will correctly tell and will be able to identify what the picture is. This is **Supervised Learning.**

# Linear Regression:
A Regression problem has a real number as its output which means that a number with a decimal point.
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on **Supervised Learning** performing a **regression task**. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between dependent and indepedent variables. What is perfoms that it predicts a dependent value (y) based on a given independent variable (x) this technique finds out the linear relationship between input (x) and output (y) and that is why its name is **Linear Regression**

# K-Nearest Neighbours:
**K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** algorithm is an easy to implement **supervised** machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both regression and classification problems. What this technique do is that it collects similar kind of data that exist in a dataset and combines them. 
**"Birds of a feather flock together"**
We can take the example of **Netflix** as if we have watched a movie whose genre was "animated" so from next time the suggestion box will show us the movies or TV series of the same genre.
